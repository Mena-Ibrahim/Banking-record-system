# Banking-record-system
This project was our first year assignement for the SP subject, it was a collabrative work shared between six team members.

# Brief documentation
This project is a banking record system, upon running the program you are directed to the login page which asks for username and password input, if the predetermined admin credentials (Username = “Admin” and Password = “Admin”) are entered, the admin is redirected to the admin panel where they have access to all data in the application. The administrator has multiple admin restricted functions including Create account, Modify account, Close account and List accounts. If, however, the data that is entered at the login page correspond to an existing user in the program database, they are directed to the user panel in which they have access to user level functions which are Balance inquiry, Deposit, Withdraw and Transfer.
The program has the essential login functions which check whether the user entered the right password or not and a logout function to allow switching between different users if needed.
The app is built to support reading and writing data from and to files, which makes for flexible user experience, this is done through the Import and Export functions which transfer the data back and forth between arrays and text files for convenience.
